    "# Introduction to TensorFlow \n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is a deep learning framework that allows you to build neural networks more easily than by hand, and thus can speed up your deep learning development significantly. However, TensorFlow is not just a deep learning library, but really a library for deep learning. It's really just a number-crunching library, similar to Numpy, but the difference is that TensorFlow allows us to perform machine-learning specific number-crunching operations (e.g. derivatives on huge matrices). Using TensorFlow, We can also easily distribute these processes across our CPU cores, GPU cores, but also across a distributed network of computers. \n",
